Public Repo for a Trivial Cronjob with Github Actions

This is a public, simplified version of a cronjob I have running using Github Actions. As configured, this job makes a single commit to the repository every day.

Please see cronjob.yml for details of this example implementation - note that to actually use this yml file in a Github actions you'll need to put it in a directory named .github/workflows.
